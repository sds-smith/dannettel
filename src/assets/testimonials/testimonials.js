        testimonial : 'I was in a bind and needed a place quite quickly I had Mr Dannettel on my side from the start. He always had new listings and updated information for me to look at in my email or text daily so I didn\'t have to stress or take the time to look. He knew what I wanted and helped me get it he was always there to answer questions (and believe me i had alot!). He was always friendly and full of the answers I needed to ease my mind and lessen the stress. If you have him on your side it just feels so comfortable like your not doing it alone it\'s a nice relief off your shoulders. I recommend him 110% all the way!',

        testimonial : 'The first time I spoke with Ed Dannettel was on the phone as a cold call from him. Ed was eager, willing and able to help us. We had a bad experience with a different realtor. I asked for advice from someone in real estate. He said, “find someone that is hungry and wants to work." Ed was this guy! He was all around the one we were looking for. Ed was able to settle our fears with the crazy market. We had to sell our previous home prior to us buying our “forever house.” Ed and Ryan came to our home within two of us speaking. They explained the process and what was to be expected from them and the market. After that day, Ed was on top of everything that was going on. Most of the time we spoke with Ed twice or more a week till our house was on the market. The week before the house went live, Ed came to the house and helped with getting it ready. The photos that were taken of the house were amazing. With our house on the market, Ed was professional, helpful, hard working and we appreciated his encouragement along the way.  He was there at the open house and spoke with everyone that came. After the open house we had multiple offers, one being $10,000 over asking. Ed was with us during the whole process.  Even before our house sold, Ed had begun to search for our home with a list of our wants and needs. Ed understood what was needed and was great at communicating. Once he had this we were in our forever home before we anticipated. This was the second home that we have purchased and we were very happy with Ed and his team. If you are looking to purchase or sell an existing home, then you need to talk with Ed Dannettel at Atlas Premier Realty. You will not be disappointed by this man and his team. Thank you Ed for all your hard work.',
